Responsive Portfolio Website

- A responsive website containing my professional information as a fullstack developer. And since I'm only a student in this regards, the site is more of a placeholder (if used beyond this assignment).

**** Reflections:

This was a lot of fun, even moments when I needed to trouble shoot. Many of those moments are expressed in the comments in the code and or in git commits (though the latter admittedly were not all too informative, I apologize).

I realize too I probably included too many bells & whistles, and I'm sure it looks amatuerish and a bit too flashy (literally too many "flashy" fx & visual noise), which I'll avoid moving forward.
